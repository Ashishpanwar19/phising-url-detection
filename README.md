# phising-url-detection
1. Project Objectives

Goal: To develop a machine learning model that can accurately detect phishing URLs based on patterns and characteristics.
Objectives:
Identify key features that distinguish phishing URLs from legitimate ones.
Build and train an ML model using labeled datasets of phishing and legitimate URLs.
Evaluate model performance based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Deploy the model for real-time URL phishing detection, with potential integration into a broader cybersecurity system.
2. Detailed Timeline with Milestones

Week 1-2: Problem Understanding and Data Collection
Research phishing techniques and URL characteristics.
Gather a labeled dataset of phishing and legitimate URLs from reliable sources.
Week 3-4: Feature Engineering and Preprocessing
Extract features (e.g., length of URL, presence of certain keywords, special characters).
Clean and preprocess the dataset for model training.
Model Building and Training
Implement and test different algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost).
Tune hyperparameters for optimal performance.
Week 7: Evaluation and Testing
Evaluate the model on unseen test data using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Test the model's robustness against adversarial examples (e.g., obfuscated phishing URLs).
Week 8: Prototype Deployment and Documentation
Prepare the prototype for deployment in a GitHub repository.
Write technical documentation and usage instructions.

Architecture Diagrams
1. High-Level Architecture Diagram
This diagram will showcase the entire system, from data input (raw URLs) to the final phishing detection output. It may include the following components:

Data Ingestion Layer: Data sources (e.g., datasets of URLs).
Preprocessing Layer: Feature extraction, data cleaning, and normalization.
Model Training: Machine learning model (e.g., Random Forest, SVM) training pipeline.
Model Inference: Real-time or batch inference system for URL detection.
2. Detailed Component Diagrams
This will include individual components and how they interact, such as:

Feature extraction pipeline: Scripts used to transform raw URLs into features.
Model training pipeline: How the data flows through various ML algorithms, including training and validation steps.
Inference pipeline: How a new URL is classified based on the trained model.
3. Network Topology (if applicable)
If the model is deployed in a networked environment, a diagram of how the system will operate in a network, including data flow between different machines or servers.
